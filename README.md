# Adversarial Defence Studies

The goal of this study is to create workable packages of existing adversarial attack and defend methods, and other visualizing tools in pytorch, and to create my own algorithm.

        --poke              to find ways to beat state of the art defence
        --shield            to find ways to defend state of the art attack
